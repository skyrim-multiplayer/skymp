# Roadmap

Welcome to the roadmap of the project! You can see synchronizations here, but there probably would also be non-sync and even non-code parts in the future.

| _Animation events_                      | Remove local delays when animation events are queued to the next frames. Disable collision when using furniture like chairs. Ask for help at ST.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| _Damage_                                | Remove incorrect range check for shooting. Blood spatter and sounds must be in sync.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| _Containers_                            | Incorrect “empty” label on a container. You should animate the opening of the container for everyone, including sounds. We probably should prepare a new API in the platform for serializing/deserializing the contents of the container, as is done in ST. This API may be the basis for future upgrades to this sync and inventory sync. 2 or more players should be able to loot a container at the same time.                                                                                                                    |
| _Equipment_                             | What is equipped in the hands is not saved when you restart the server, but it should.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| _Picking up items_                      | Take into account ExtraData (charm, poison, etc., impossible without throwing away the corresponding items). The message about adding an item should be like in the original: “Added…”. Synchronize pickup sound. When activating a book item, the reading interface should open, not picking up a book in inventory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| _Picking up ingredients_                | The message must be as in the original, the sound must be as in the original and synchronized, the object must not blink and/or move.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| _Torches_                               | Player should be able to set a player on fire with a torch. It should be synced. Also we should remove torch from the inventory after some time on the server. In the current version, torches are limitless like arrows also are.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| _Scripts_                               | Variables need to be preserved, needs to be figured out how events work differently from the original Skyrim and documented (at least).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| _Console commands_                      | Make a list of popular console commands, implement them. They should be typed as in the original game. Their output should also be the same. Implement a system of permissions that determines who can use which commands. Perhaps make it possible to use them on the server from stdin (https://github.com/lionkor/commandline), as well as selectors like in Minecraft - applying to all entities or to specific ones. On the client, the player IDs in the console should show the server ID, not the local one.                 |

| _Picking up leveled items_              | In CK they start with the word Dummy, eg. RandomPotion. I'm not sure how the server handles them now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| _Effects learning_                      | When eating an ingredient, the character learns its effects, this information should not be reset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| _Favorites_                             | When adding an item, spell, etc. to your favorites, this should be saved when you reconnect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| _Dropping items_                        | First, without physics: spawn a discarded object in the legs. After implementing the physics, dropping items should work like it did in the original game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| _Physics_                               | Ability to kick objects, movable statics and even some containers (the blue palace has a physical container).

| _Dungeon support_                       | Traps, puzzles and more - test, fix what doesn't work. Everything should work as in original game. State must be saved on the server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Bonus: the required position of the lockpick should not change during hacking attempts, synchronize the sounds of hacking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| _Skills_                                | Disable the original leveling formulas and add the ability to level skills for existing synchronizations, such as combat skills. When developing each new synchra, take into account the associated skill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| _Marksman_                              | Perhaps use a mod that allows you to look up and down to synchronize the vertical angle of the character. The arrow must have the correct initial speed, fly out from where it is needed. Perhaps it will be possible to pick it up - at the initial stage, you can not do it. Perhaps the arrows stuck in the characters should be synchronized. The server must remove 1 arrow after each shot.                                                                                                                                    |

| _Magic effects_                         | The server must be able to cast a magical effect on a person. The use of the potion should impose a magical effect, and not instantly change health parameters, as it happens now. The appearance of the magic effect is accompanied by the playback of the shader effect. Even if the moment of applying the magic effect on another player was not visible, when you enter the visibility zone, you should see the effect of the shader. The most popular effect archetypes should be implemented (with which we attack and heal). |

| _Wait_                                  | Players should be able to sleep/wait if all players on the server are willing to do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| _Statics_                               | The server should “see” them (do everything lazily and once again not spoil the database. It is desirable to be able to reset the state of such an object, completely clearing everything). We need to be able to move them around with SetPosition, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| _ActorValues_                           | Now only stamina, mana and health, but you need to be able to manipulate all ActorValues on the server side.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| _Sounds and music_                      | Music can definitely be synchronized within cells, work with combat music - now it is included in PvP. Now, also after death, the music of death is superimposed on another. We should be able to play sounds from Art. server in a specific location (Seems to be decided by SpSnippet). Also, you need to define a set of actions for which the sounds will be synchronized.                                                                                                                                                       |

| _Linked Refs_                           | As far as I remember, linking propagates activation - this is important for dungeons, there is often a lever linked to a door, for example.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
