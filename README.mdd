SkyMP is an open-source multiplayer mod for Skyrim âš¡

SkyMP is built on top of the [SkyrimPlatform](docs/docs_skyrim_platform.md) - a tool to create Skyrim mods with TypeScript and Chromium. ðŸš€

This repo hosts all sources to ease local setup and contributing. See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for build instructions.

### What's Synced

- [x] Player movement and animation sync
- [x] Appearance: race, headparts, tints, etc
- [x] PvP sync: melee damage, attributes, death
- [x] Inventory sync: equipment, containers, craft, etc
- [x] Limited scripts sync (WIP) - we have our own Papyrus engine
- [ ] Who knows what comes next? We work on synchronizing all Skyrim game mechanics, see [ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md).

### Multiplayer Features

- Mostly server-controlled game state - you can't cheat everything
- Store your world in plain files or MongoDB
- Customize your server with TypeScript or Papyrus scripting
- Use esp/esm mods, just ensure both client and server load order are the same
