## Pull Requests

- **Your branch must be buildable** - The project's build system must be able to build repo with your changes.

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Give a reasonable name to your PR** - It would help to process your PR.

- **Format your C++ code** - Make sure that you format your C++ code with rules in `.clang-format`.

- **Format your TypeScript code** - For now, keep the same formatting as modified documents have (`RMB -> Format Document` in VS Code). Double quotes (" ") are used to represent a string in TypeScript code.

- **Prefer spaces over tabs** - To prevent inconsistent formatting. Applies to all languages.

- **Commit naming doesn't matter for you** - There are no strict rules in commit naming you must follow. Maintainers are responsible for fixing commit names.

- **Keep Git history clean** - Push only necessary changes. Change file paths only if necessary.

- **Remove code instead of turning it into comments** - Let Git manage history for you instead.

- **No offensive language in code** - Let's code and comment in ways that do not hurt anyone.
