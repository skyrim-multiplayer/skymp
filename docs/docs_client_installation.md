# Client Installation

Once you build this repo, you can see `build/dist/client` folder. It would contain all files required to run SkyMP client. You just have to copy these files into your Skyrim SE folder.

SkyMP client requires SKSE to be installed in your game. Go to https://skse.silverlock.org/ and install `Current SE build`.
