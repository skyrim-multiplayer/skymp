Welcome to Skyrim Multiplayer Docs portal. We store the API references, manuals, tutorials there.

Writing a good guide is always hard. Anyone who has tried it once knows how insanely time consuming and tedious it is to create a clear, user-friendly, and concise document. We would love to see your contributions to this wiki on GitHub.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact us via [Discord](https://discord.gg/k39uQ9Yudt) or sending an email directly to mod's author: `pospelovlm@yandex.ru`.
