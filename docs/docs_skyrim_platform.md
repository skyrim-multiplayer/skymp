## Versioning Notes

SP follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for JavaScript, but not for TypeScript.

It means that non-major updates won't break compiled TypeScript plugins or plugins written in JavaScript. If they do, treat it as an SP bug then.

On the other hand, updating `skyrimPlatform.ts` may break the compilation of your TypeScript plugins. You likely will be able to easily fix these problems, or ask for help in our Discord server, or just use `skyrimPlatform.ts` from one of the previous versions.
