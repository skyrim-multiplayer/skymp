# Server Configuration Reference

The recommended way to configure the server is setting up all required values in `server-settings.json`. It's standard JSON without C-style comments support. See also [Server Command Line API](docs_server_command_line_api.md).

## name

Server's name that will be published on a master server.

```json5
{
  // ...
  "name": "My Server"
  // ...
}
```

## ip

This IP-address would be used by player clients to connect to your server. Do not try to type `"0.0.0.0"`, just remove this option from document if you want to use your current public IP.

```json5
{
  // ...
  "ip": "127.0.0.1"
  // ...
}
```

## port

This port would be used by player clients to connect to your server. At the current version of Skyrim Multiplayer servers use multiple ports and different protocols to manage different sorts of packets. See [Server Ports Usage](docs_server_ports_usage.md) page to learn more.

```json5
{
  // ...
  "port": 7777
  // ...
}
```

## maxPlayers

Sets player limit of the server. Visible in launcher and on skymp.io.

```json5
{
  // ...
  "maxPlayers": 108
  // ...
}
```

## dataDir

Contains relative or absolute path to a "data" directory which contains:
* vanilla Skyrim master files (Skyrim.esm, Update.esm, etc)
* plugin files (mods in .esp format)
* compiled Papyrus scripts in .pex format

This directory is exposed to `uiPort` and available via http.

At this moment, the server uses this directory for non-vanilla needs too:
* storing web-based GUI in `${dataDir}/ui`
* storing auto-generated manifest describing .esm/.esp files used and CRC32 of them

```json5
{
  // ...
  "dataDir": "data"
  // ...
}
```

## loadOrder

A list of relative or absolute paths to .esp/.esm files which would be loaded by the server during startup in the same order as Skyrim SE loads them.

Relative paths are searched in `${dataDir}` directory.

Absolute paths work but aren't accessible via `uiPort`. External tooling wouldn't be able to download them from the server.

```json5
{
  // ...
  "loadOrder": [
    "Skyrim.esm",
    "Update.esm",
    "Dawnguard.esm",
    "HearthFires.esm",
    "Dragonborn.esm"
  ]
  // ...
}
```

## lang

The language, the translation of which will be obtained from the string files located in Data/strings

```json5
{
  // ...
  "lang": "english"
  // ...
}
```

## offlineMode

The boolean variable shows is server in "offline mode" or not (the server allows clients to connect with any profile id they choose).
Users need to specify `"profileId"` in their `skymp5-settings.txt`.

```json5
{
  // ...
  "offlineMode": true
  // ...
}
```

## databaseDriver

Name of a database driver which would be used to store server data. `file` by default. There are also related options like `"databaseName"`. See [Database Drivers](docs_database_drivers.md) page to learn more.

```json5
{
  // ...
  "databaseDriver": "file"
  // ...
}
```

## reloot

A time before a game object restores its original state in milliseconds. Unlike Skyrim SE, Skyrim Multiplayer doesn't have a built-in Cell Reset mechanism. The server resets every object in the world every hour instead. With this option, you can change this time interval for every kind of game object. `"CONT"`, for example, means "Container" - chests, barrels, etc. See "record types" on [UESP](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim_Mod:Mod_File_Format).

```json5
{
  // ...
  "reloot": {
    "FLOR": 86400000,
    "TREE": 86400000,
    "AMMO": 86400000,
    "ARMO": 86400000,
    "BOOK": 86400000,
    "INGR": 86400000,
    "ALCH": 86400000,
    "SCRL": 86400000,
    "CONT": 86400000,
    "SLGM": 86400000,
    "WEAP": 86400000,
    "MISC": 86400000
  }
  // ...
}
```

## gamemodePath

Contains a relative or an absolute path to a file or directory with a gamemode.
Searches for `index.js` if a directory specified.

```json5
{
  // ...
  "gamemodePath": "gamemode.js"
  // ...
}
```

## startPoints

Contains a list of spawn points, one of which will be chosen at random.

```json5
{
  // ...
  "startPoints": [
    {
      "pos": [22659, -8697, -3594],
      "worldOrCell": "0x1a26f",
      "angleZ": 268
    }
  ]
  // ...
}
```

## isPapyrusHotReloadEnabled

A boolean setting that enables to turn on or turn off hot reload for compiled Papyrus scripts (.pex)

```json5
{
  // ...
  "isPapyrusHotReloadEnabled": false
  // ...
}
```

## locale

The name of a localizaiton file in `data/localization` that would be used by `M.GetText` Papyrus function (without extension).

```json5
{
  // ...
  "locale": "ru-RU"
  // ...
}
```

## sweetPieMinimumPlayersToStart

The minimal amount of players to begin deathmatch. This setting is sweetpie only and does not affect vanilla server. By default is 5.

```json5
{
  // ...
  "sweetPieMinimumPlayersToStart": 5
  // ...
}
```

## sweetPieAllowCheats

Prevents the gamemode from disabling cheats. This setting is sweetpie only and does not affect vanilla server. Default is false.

```json5
{
  // ...
  "sweetPieAllowCheats": true
  // ...
}
```

## sweetPieChatSettings

Allows tuning settings related to in-game chat, such as message visibility radius.

```json5
{
  // ...
  "sweetPieChatSettings": {
    // Hearing distance in units. If player A says something and player B is farther away, they won't see that message.
    "hearingRadiusNormal": 123,
  },
  // ...
}
```
