## Fix vulnerability in `writeLogs` method

Without the fix, we were able to write text files wherever we wanted in the host system:

```typescript
writeLogs("../foo", "111");
// or even:
writeLogs("../../foo", "111");
```
Currently, SP doesn't allow writing/reading file system by plugins except for the Data folder. It's by design. However, PapyrusUtil/JContainers/other plugins can expose everything and that's ok.
