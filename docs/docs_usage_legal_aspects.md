# Usage Legal Aspects

SkyMP is free software in terms of freedom. We want to keep our license and code clearly marked to ensure that we get the best out of our hard work for the community. We also want to hype our GitHub repos to receive contributions and feedback as much as possible.

## Mentioning SkyMP

We would greatly appreciate you if you add links to our resources.

* GitHub repo: https://github.com/skyrim-multiplayer/skymp
* Website: https://skymp.io

But avoid positioning yourself as SkyMP, Skyrim Multiplayer, or SkyMP Team, etc. We are strictly against it, and also against using our logo, project name to promote yourself. The reason is we want to control the public positioning of our project.

* Please do not use the SkyMP logo as your main logo.
* Do not start your project description with "SkyMP is ...". Tell about your project first.
* Consider not starting your project name with SkyMP: `"Immersive Foo Bar Project - SkyMP Server"` is ok. `"SkyMP - Immersive Foo Bar Project"` is not.
* If you use "SkyMP" word attaching links to our resources is required.

## License

SkyMP is licensed under GPLv3. Learn more here: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.en.html

If you take code from our repo, as we are GPLv3 that makes your code base GPLv3.

In practice it means that you at least:
* Must add GPLv3 or compatible license as a license file to your repo.
* Must distribute actual source code of your project. The best way is to make your GitHub repo public, you will feat all legal requirements and have a chance to receive contributions from third-party developers.
* Must add attribution in the following format to your license file. You may use our license file as an example: since we use third-party GPLv3 code, it contains attributions in the footer.

## Nexus Mods Recomendations

### Permissions

Assuming that your codebase uses SkyMP codebase which makes it GPLv3.

If you publish your work on Nexus, be aware of setting correct permissions. This is more about compliance with objective reality rather than actually choosing permissions.

* **Upload permission**, **Modification permission**, **Conversion permission**, **Asset use permission** - Essential permissions that are guaranted by a GPLv3 license.
* **Asset use permission in mods/files that are being sold** - This permission is in fact also being granted. GPLv3 doesn't restrict making money but prohibits closed-source projects.
* **Asset use permission in mods/files that earn donation points** - Same as for previous permission. It's legal to make money on GPLv3 software as long as you meet other requirements of this license.

You are responsible for informing your users about permissions correctly. Choosing the wrong permissions doesn't have any effect on the real legal state of your work and doesn't shadow the GPLv3 license.
